# Changelog of the fleaTLS cryptographic library
# http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/
#
# fleaTLS uses semantic versioning. However, in verion 1 there will still be
# minor API changes between minor versions. From version 2 on, API changes will
# only appear in new major versions.
#

## [ X.X.X ] UNRELEASED

### Fixed
- insufficient initialization in the flea_ae_ctx_t__INIT macro resp. ctor, leading to
use of uninitialized value in the flea_ae_ctx_t object and thus faulty
computations. No security implications known.

### Changed
- renamed THR_flea_ecb_mode_crypt_data to THR_flea_ecb_ctx_t__crypt_data to
fit the naming convention

### Removed
- all <type>__INIT_VALUE macros and accordingly FLEA_DECL_OBJ(). They introduce too much redundancy and compatibility
issues with C++. Their use needs to be replaced by usage of the corresponding
<type>__INIT() macro.

## [ 1.3.0 ] 2018-04-19 cryptosource GmbH	info@fleatls.com

### Fixed
- fixed ECDSA signature encoding bug when using secp160r1 (order bit length = 161)
with hash algorithm with more than 160 bits output
- fixed premature breaking when reading compression methods list in clientHello, potentially causing handshake
failures when compression is offered by the client. Reported by Andreas Walz (Hochschule Offenburg) [andreas.walz@hs-offenburg.de]

### Added
- C-file based read stream
- TLS PSK cipher suites

### Changed
- removed version number from built library file

## [1.2.1] 2018-03-27 cryptosource GmbH  info@fleatls.com

### Fixed
- fixed fleaTLS version number in build system
- fixed theoretical off-by-one error in ANSI X9.62 encoding (cannot be triggered
by currently supported curves)

## [1.2.0] 2018-03-21 cryptosource GmbH  info@fleatls.com

### Added
- added ECDSA ciphersuites for TLS
- added the CPT default test suite for the X.509 functionility 

### Removed 
- pubkey/privkey API: sign and verfiy function "..._plain_format". Choice of 
signature format for ECDSA (concatentation of r and s vs. ASN.1/DER encoded
signature) is now controlled via the public key scheme variable.

### Fixed
- corrected maximal allowed value in API documentation of build variable FLEA_TLS_ALT_SEND_BUF_SIZE
- fixed an error in the unit test code in function THR_flea_test_cbc_mode_3des() for
certain build configurations
- fixed an error in ECDSA signature decoding in TLS certificate chains
- fixed error in EC curve OID resolving
- fixed build error that occurred when disabling mutex usage in build
configuration
- fixed some minor functional bugs regarding TLS signature algorithm and hash algorithm
negotiation
- fixed ECDSA signature encoding when hash value is longer than base point order


## [1.1.0] 2018-01-23  cryptosource GmbH  info@fleatls.com

### Added
- X.509 and CRL processing
- GCM mode
- TLS 1.2
- Public and private key types
- Side channel countermeasures
- RNG functionality

### Changed
- Public Key Operations API
- Library Initialization function
- normalized order of input/output arguments for CBC-mode functions

### Fixed
- incorrect use of some enums for MACs
- erroneous MAC computation in case HMAC was instantiated with a specific key size
