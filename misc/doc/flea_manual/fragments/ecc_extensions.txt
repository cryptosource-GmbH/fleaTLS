ECC specific Client and Server Extensions

Client Hello Extensions
  elliptic_curves
    contains ec curves supported by the client in order of preference
  ec_point_formats
    contains supported point formats
    must contain "uncompressed"
    if not present, this is equivalent to only "uncompressed"

The server must respect the specifications made by these extensions in all uses
of EC curves (his ECDSA certificate and ephemeral ECDH key)

Server Hello Extensions
  supported_point_formats (for the curve that will appear in its
ServerKeyExchange)


Server Certificate Message (in all non-anon. HS):
"If the client has used a
   Supported Elliptic Curves Extension, the public key in the server's
   certificate MUST respect the client's choice of elliptic curves"
"the public key [used by the server] MUST employ a named curve (not the same
   curve as an explicit curve) unless the client has indicated support
   for explicit curves of the appropriate type"
