## [1.2. Unreleased] 2018-XX-XX cryptosource GmbH  info@fleatls.com

### Added
- ECDSA ciphersuites for TLS

### Removed 
- pubkey/privkey API: sign and verfiy function "..._plain_format". Control over
signature format of ECDSA (concatentation of r and s vs. ASN.1/DER encoded
signature) is now controlled via the public key scheme variable.

### Fixed
- corrected maximal allowed value in API documentation of build variable FLEA_TLS_ALT_SEND_BUF_SIZE
- fixed an error in the unit test code in function THR_flea_test_cbc_mode_3des() for
certain build configurations
- fixed an error in ECDSA signature decoding in TLS certificate chains
- fixed build error that occurred when disabling mutex usage
